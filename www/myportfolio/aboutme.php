                <p>Hello there! I am Lars and I am a student. I study on the school: Curio Breda software development. I started software development myself 1 year ago. I started making websites and applications. 3 years ago I started game development. I was interested in games and I always wanted to make games. I eventually quit game development and started web and software development. I really like it and I want to do more with this skill.</p>
